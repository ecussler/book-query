# Book Query - Challenge 21 [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]
  
  ## Description
  This project took a RESTful API application for a book query and refactored it using GraphQL. The started code we were given was a working RESTful API application allowing users to sign-up, login, search for books and save/delete books from their collection. 
 
  The purpose of this exercise was to refactor the application to work with GraphQL, working on both the front and back end to get the application working again. 

  This application uses: 
  - GraphQL
  - MongoDB 
  - React
